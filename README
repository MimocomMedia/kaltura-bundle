This is the Sakai OAE / Kaltura integration. 
Developed by Aaron Zeckoski (Lead) of Unicon for Kaltura and New York University.

Sakai OAE:  http://sakaiproject.org/node/2239
Kaltura:    http://corp.kaltura.com/

Introduction
------------
This integration will intercept media files which are loaded into Sakai OAE and then 
send them over to the Kaltura server (as configured). The OAE content item will be updated
with Kaltura specific data so that a Kaltura player can be rendered for the user.
This is all seamless to the end user (they should not even realize they are using Kaltura).
